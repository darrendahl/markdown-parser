# markdown-parser

- Simple markdown parser that adds the html tags needed to render the formatting but keeps original symbols.

- This way the user can add/remove markdown formatting without the need of a toolbar or unintuitive UX, as well as the user seeing what markdown symbols are causing the formatting.
